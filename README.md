# EE371_Labs

This is a collection of the SystemVerilog labs that I have written for my EE 371 "Design of Digital Circuits and Systems" class. I took this class at the University of Washington during spring quarter 2021 with Prof. Rania Hussein. I worked on Lab 1-3 alone, and collaborated with Hunter North on the completion of Lab 4-6.
